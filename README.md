##  Week Eight HOMEWORK- If/Else Statements, Comparison Operators, & Logical Operators

### Objectives
Practice your if/else statements by making a choose your own adventure game!

### Project

Finish the updateAdventure function by following the prompts in the comments.

There are a lot of ways to manage these if statements - see if you can find the most efficient solution!

If you finish early, try to update the story, or create a more interesting layout using CSS.

NOTE: The code in the solutions folder works, but is NOT the most efficient way to solve this problem.
